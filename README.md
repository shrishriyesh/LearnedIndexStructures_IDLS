# LearnedIndexStructures

This is a project completed by Shriyesh Chandra and Jayanth Reddy for the Introduction to Deep Learning Systems course taken by Prof. Parijat Dube in Fall 2023.

## Abstract
Traditional indexing methods, while efficient, are not adaptive to varying data distributions. This limits their
performance in diverse, real-world applications. Neural networks are good at learning unknown data distributions.
We use this property of neural networks to build Learned Indexes tuned to the specific datasets. 
This theoretically would allow us to perform index lookups in O(1) amortized time as compared to traditional indexes
like B-Trees which take O(log(n)) time.

## Project Details
We experimented with different model architectures and decided to use a 2 layer neural network with 128 neurons
in each layer. We used the ReLU activation function and ADAM optimizer. The model complexity was balanced to ensure
good predictive performance while limiting complexity to ensure low inference latencies. We also used GPUs for inference
which resulted in a significant speedup over benchmark results. 
Model performance was further improved by JIT-compiling PyTorch code into optimized kernels.

We evaluated the model's performance over three datasets with different distributions:
- normal_200M_uint32: 200 million unsigned 32-bit integers generated from a normal (Gaussian) distribution
- lognormal_200M_uint32: 200 million unsigned 32-bit integers drawn from a lognormal distribution
- uniform_sparse_200M_uint32: 200 million unsigned 32-bit integers that are sparce and uniformly distributed


## Results
All experiments were ran on a 24-core Intel Xeon Platinum 8268 processor with 32GB V100 Nvidia GPU and 12.2 CUDA version.  
- Since our goal is to learn the training data distribution, we could overfit on the training data. 
- Loss metric used was Mean Square Error.
- All datasets converged to < 8E-7 loss in 100 epochs taking less than 60s to train.
- Peak memory consumption ~100M (an unclustered B-Tree index takes > 1GB)
- R-squared nearly 1
- Query latency of around 1ms for 100k queries, which translates to 4.5x speedup over benchmark implementation (SOSD RMI). 
Speedup is around 40x over benchmark BTree implementation.

## Conclusions
- Our Model’s query time due to its optimizations is significantly faster than traditional indexing methods 
- Primary focused was to improve read performance, although we have ensured the model can retrain in less than a minute when it receives writes.
- Model performs well with diverse data distributions, this demonstrates its robustness.
- Memory consumption is <10% of what a B-Tree would consume
